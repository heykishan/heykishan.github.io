**Professionally:**
Im a technical consultant at [Ryewalk](https://ryewalk.com) working on digital transformation projects with a focus on  Salesforce based solutions. Previously I've worked in simlar roles at [CloudSense](https://cloudsense.com) and [Deloitte](https://deloitte.com).

**Personally:**
I do a little bit of everything here and there. Ive been a bibliophile for a while now, more books brought than read. My favorite genres are non-fiction (astronomy, physics, geopolitics, economics & business), and historical fiction thrillers.

Beyond books, I like to do visual astronomy & some theoretical astrophysics. I serve on the core team at [Chennai Astronomy Club](https://chennaiastronomyclub.org).

Im also an avid sports fan following Tennis, (English) Football, F1 and like to play Tennis, Cricket and Chess whenever I can. Travel is another pursuitâ€”having nearly explored Southeast Asia with Europe on my near-future horizon.

While Im not doing any of the above, I like indulge in a new found hobby of fragrances & perfumery.
